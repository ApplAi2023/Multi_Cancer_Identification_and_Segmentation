# Multi_Cancer_Identification_and_Segmentation
## Project Name: Multi Cancer Identification and Segmentation
### Description:
This project uses deep learning techniques to classify x-ray images as either brain or breast images. It then classifies each image by the type of cancer present, and if cancer is detected, it segments the affected area. Our team took first place in a competition using this approach.

### Technologies Used:
Python 3 <br />
TensorFlow <br />
Keras   
OpenCV   <br />
NumPy
