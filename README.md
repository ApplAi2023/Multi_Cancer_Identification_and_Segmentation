# Multi_Cancer_Identification_and_Segmentation

## Description:
This project uses deep learning techniques to classify x-ray images as either brain or breast images. It then classifies each image by the type of cancer present, and if cancer is detected, it segments the affected area. Our team took first place in a competition using this approach.

### Technologies Used:
Python 3 <br />
TensorFlow <br />
Keras   
OpenCV   <br />
NumPy

## Model Weights
This project uses pre-trained weights to achieve state-of-the-art performance on our task. The weights were trained on a large dataset and are essential for replicating our results.

You can download the weights for our model at the following link: [Weights](https://drive.google.com/file/d/10Lp84EMHdtItv8tEB9cJJ_phRu8VXOnM/view?usp=drivesdk). The weights are stored in a compressed file format and can be loaded into your project.

**Note**: The weights file is large and may take some time to download. Alternatively, you can use a cloud storage service such as Google Drive, Dropbox, or Amazon S3 to download the file faster.

**To load the weights into your project, follow these steps:**

* Download the weights file and extract the contents.

* Move the weights file to the appropriate directory in your project.

If you have any issues with the weights or need further assistance, please don't hesitate to reach out to us.
